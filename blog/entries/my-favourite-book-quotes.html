<h3>William S. Burroughs</h3>
<br />
<h4>Junky</h4>

  <i
    >He has a large straight nose. His lips are thin and purple-blue like the
    lips of a penis. The skin is tight and smooth over his face. He is basically
    obscene beyond any possible vile act or practice. He has the mark of a
    certain trade or occupation that no longer exists.</i

  <i
    >Waves of hostility and suspicion flowed out from his large brown eyes like
    some sort of television broadcast. The effect was almost like a physical
    impact.</i

<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i
    >He had the embalmed look of all bondsmen, as though paraffin had been
    injected under the skin.</i

</p>
<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i
    >If you walked fast down a crowded street and passed Dupré, his face would
    be forced on your memory—like in the card trick where the operator fans the
    cards rapidly, saying, “Take a card, any card,” as he forces a certain card
    into your hand.</i

  <i
    >He has a knack of pitching his whiny voice directly into your
    consciousness. No external noise drowns him out. Robbins looks like some
    unsuccessful species of </i
  >Homo non sapiens<i>, blackmailing the human race with his existence.</i>
</p>
<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i
    >Antonio the Portuguese is mooch to the bone. He won’t work. In a sense, he
    can’t work. He is a mutilated fragment of the human potential, specialized
    to the point where he cannot exist without a host. His mere presence is an
    irritation. Phantom tendrils reach out from him, feeling for a point of
    weakness on which to fasten.</i

<h4>Naked Lunch</h4>
<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i>
    Followers of obsolete unthinkable trades, doodling in Etruscan, addicts of
    drugs not yet synthesized, black marketeers of World War III, excisors of
    telepathic sensitivity, osteopaths of the spirit, investigators of
    infractions denounced by bland paranoid chess players, servers of
    fragmentary warrants taken down in hebephrenic shorthand charging
    unspeakable mutilations of the spirit, officials of unconstituted police
    states, brokers of exquisite dreams and nostalgias tested on the sensitized
    cells of junk sickness and bartered for raw materials of the will, drinkers
    of the Heavy Fluid sealed in translucent amber of dreams.

    So there he is, standing by my bed, cadaverous in a black-blue
    overcoat—midnight-blue overcoat—and his eyes brighter than I ever saw them,
    gleaming in the dark, the shades drawn, you understand, I mean, I was
    sleeping—And he says, "You going to lay there on your bed with all these
    shipments coming in?" And I says "Why not? What else? This isn't any fuckin
    farm." And he got right in bed with me, overcoat, shoes and all. And I said
    "What's the matter with you. You crazy?" And I looked into his bright eyes
    and saw that he was.

    I know this one pusher walks around humming a tune and everybody he passes
    takes it up. He is so grey and spectral and anonymous they don't see him and
    think it is their own mind humming the tune.

    Junk is the ideal product... the ultimate merchandise. No sales talk
    necessary. The client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy... The junk
    merchant does not sell his product to the consumer, he sells the consumer to
    his product. He does not improve and simplify his merchandise. He degrades
    and simplifies the client.

  <i
    >Tinted aluminum plates, long sheets of weatherproofed glass, dymaxion
    torsions: the synthetic contents of a collective architectural grab bag.
    Clean, well lighted, cheap to heat, functional, can be torn down and
    replaced over a long weekend or transported to Las Vegas by helicopter,
    demolition incorporated in the structural design. A nod to mortality.</i

    >All about them the golden girls, shopping for dainties in Lairville. Even
    in the midst of the wild-maned winter’s chill, skipping about in sneakers
    and sweatsocks, cream-colored raincoats. A generation in the mold, the Great
    White Pattern Maker lying in his prosperous bed, grinning while the liquid
    cools. But he does not know my bellows. Someone there is who will huff and
    will puff. The sophomores in their new junior blazers, like Saturday’s
    magazines out on Thursday. Freshly covered textbooks from the campus store,
    slide rules dangling in leather, sheathed broadswords, chinos scrubbed to
    the virgin fiber, starch pressed into straight-razor creases, Oxford shirts
    buttoned down under crewneck sweaters, blue eyes bobbing everywhere, stunned
    by the android synthesis of one-a-day vitamins, Tropicana orange juice,
    fresh country eggs, Kraft homogenized cheese, tetrapacks of fortified milk,
    Cheerios with sun-ripened bananas, corn-flake-breaded chicken, hot fudge
    sundaes, Dairy Queen root beer floats, cheeseburgers, hybrid creamed corn,
    riboflavin extract, brewer’s yeast, crunchy peanut butter, tuna fish
    casseroles, pancakes and imitation maple syrup, chuck steaks, occasional
    Maine lobster, Social Tea biscuits, defatted wheat germ, Kellogg’s
    Concentrate, chopped string beans, Wonderbread, Bosco, Birds Eye frozen
    peas, shredded spinach, French-fried onion rings, escarole salads, lentil
    stews, sundry fowl innards, Pecan Sandies, Almond Joys, aureomycin,
    penicillin, antitetanus toxoid, smallpox vaccine, Alka- Seltzer, Empirin,
    Vicks VapoRub, Arrid with chlorophyll, Super Anahist nose spray, Dristan
    decongestant, billions of cubic feet of wholesome, reconditioned breathing
    air, and the more wholesome breeds of fraternal exercise available to
    Western man. Ah, the regimented good will and force-fed confidence of those
    who are not meek but will inherit the earth all the same.</i

    >Around him were his stacked canvas, never static, always in flux, sections
    being painted out and annihilated with the same pitch and rhythm as the ones
    taking on substance. The demolition of self. A sucking vortex, Gnossos
    always reasoned, the diameter of which narrowed over the years, pulled
    closer to the pinpoint when creation and destruction were one. Then, with
    any luck, he’d die.</i

  <i
    >My heyday never truly known, stolen away when my tomtit back was turned,
    stuffed in a cheesecloth sack, weighted with lead mortality sinkers, sunk in
    the fetid Gowanus Canal. Offspring the only chance, little Gnossi, but
    without love, the membrane holds. How long? Unborn children congealing,
    opiated brain cells whispering “waste,” bowels thick with constipated
    horror. Oh, Thanatos baby, come give your easy kiss, old steel tongue into
    my mouth, taste the sweet oxide, bury me on a bunny-rabbit sidehill, Grün’s
    pigtailed daughters sprinkling petals on my cindered grave. But nothing
    grows.</i

<h4>The Doors Of Perception And Heaven And Hell</h4>
<br />
<p>This one is non-fiction in case you're not familiar lol</p>
<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i
    >We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in
    all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the
    arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to
    fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By
    its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in
    solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies—all these are private and,
    except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool
    information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From
    family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.</i

  <i
    >The mind is its own place, and the places inhabited by the insane and the
    exceptionally gifted are so different from the places where ordinary men and
    women live, that there is little or no common ground of memory to serve as a
    basis for understanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail to
    enlighten. The things and events to which the symbols refer belong to
    mutually exclusive realms of experience.</i

  <i
    >From the records of religion and the surviving monuments of poetry and the
    plastic arts it is very plain that, at most times and in most places, men
    have attached more importance to the inscape than to objective existents,
    have felt that what they saw with their eyes shut possessed a spiritually
    higher significance than what they saw with their eyes open. The reason?
    Familiarity breeds contempt, and how to survive is a problem ranging in
    urgency from the chronically tedious to the excruciating. The outer world is
    what we wake up to every morning of our lives, is the place where,
    willy-nilly, we must try to make our living. In the inner world there is
    neither work nor monotony. We visit it only in dreams and musings, and its
    strangeness is such that we never find the same world on two successive
    occasions. What wonder, then, if human beings in their search for the divine
    have generally preferred to look within!</i

<h4>Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas</h4>
<br />
<p class="content-indent">
  <i
    >You approach the turnstiles leading into the Circus-Circus and you know
    that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won’t
    let you inside … but when you get there, everything goes wrong: you misjudge
    the distance to the turnstile and slam against it, bounce off and grab hold
    of an old woman to keep from falling, some angry Rotarian shoves you and you
    think: What’s happening here? What’s going on? Then you hear yourself
    mumbling: “Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out! … Why money?
    My name is Brinks; I was born … born? Get sheep over side … women and
    children to armored car … orders from Captain Zeep.”</i

    >Now off the escalator and into the casino, big crowds still tight around
    the crap tables. Who are these people? These faces! Where do they come from?
    They look like caricatures of used-car dealers from Dallas. But they’re
    real. And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them—still screaming
    around these desert-city crap tables at four-thirty on a Sunday morning.
    Still humping the American Dream, that vision of the Big Winner somehow
    emerging from the last-minute pre-dawn chaos of a stale Vegas casino.</i
