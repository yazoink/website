  Recently, I have found an interest in the "cut-up" technique of writing
  pioneered by William S. Burroughs, with the influence of Brion Gysin, in the
  1950s and 1960s. This technique involves the cutting and rearranging of text,
  transmuting it into a new body in order to establish new meanings and
  connections.

  The primary inspiration behind the <i>cut-up</i> was the collage technique
  often employed in visual arts. Its purpose is to create a text that is closer
  to memory and perception than traditional representational writing and art. It
  should be noted that the results of this technique are often reminiscent of
  dream speech, psychotic speech, hypnogogia, and abstract thought processes.

  I have explained how in 1959 Brion Gysin said that writing is fifty years
  behind painting and applied the montage technique to writing — a technique
  which had been used in painting for fifty years. As you know, painters had the
  whole representational position knocked out from under them by photography,
  and there was in fact a photography exhibition around the turn of the century
  entitled ‘Photography — The Death of Painting’. Premature, but painting did
  have to get a new look. So painters turned first to montage.<br /><br />Now
  the montage is actually much closer to the facts of perception, than
  representational painting. Take a walk down a city street and put what you
  have just seen down on canvas. You have seen half a person cut in two by a
  car, bits and pieces of street signs and advertisements, reflections from shop
  windows — a montage of fragments. And the same thing happens with words.
  Remember that the written word is an image. Brion Gysin’s cut-up method
  consists of cutting up pages of text and re-arranging them in montage
  combinations.

  I decided to attempt to create a piece of writing using cut-ups, drawing the
  sources from a collection of quotes from books that I’ve been building
  recently; hand-writing them on scraps of paper in order to commit them to my
  memory. I have been trying to extract connections, common themes,
  philosophies, motifs, from these quotes in order to understand them more and
  solidify some kind of philosophy or world-view to live by (this could be a
  whole tangent in itself but I’ll just leave it here and potentially write
  about it in detail another time). The idea was that using cut-ups could loosen
  my view of these books and quotes and reduce them to loose concepts, ideas,
  and imagery; ready to run along the veins of free association.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The original quotes came from a variety of authors, including: William S.
  Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Aldous Huxley,
  Richard Farina, Gilles Deleuze, Jack Kerouac, and one each from Hunter S.
  Thompson and Sylvia Plath. Below is the text I created, dashes separating the
  “cuts.”

  <i>
    The odd state of the soul in which the void becomes eloquent – Must be the
    purest meat and no symbolic dressing – The miracle, moment by moment, of
    naked existence – Whatever this may be it is </i
  >not<i>
    a table – More remote than a lost paradise – Not limited to what is
    biologically or socially useful – This confrontation between the human need
    and the unreasonable silence of the world – Can we infer conditions where
    none of our laws apply including the constant speed of light? – A stranger
    to myself and the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as
    soon as it asserts – I should personally like to renounce speech altogether
    – Say here is the obligate cellular parasite – In marketing research that’s
    exactly what they do … like for political purposes, to make a little slogan
    – always and in all circumstances we are by ourselves.<br /><br />Opening
    bars of “East St. Louis Toodle-oo” … at times loud and clear then faint and
    intermittent like music down a windy street – To will is to stir up
    paradoxes – The individual never ceases passing from one closed environment
    to another – Actual vision and actual prisons – Tinted aluminum plates, long
    sheets of weatherproofed glass, dymaxion torsions: the synthetic contents of
    an architectural grab bag – And O the holy sea of Mazatlan and the great red
    plain of eve with burros and aznos and red and brown horses and green cactus
    pulque – And there was his hand, like a fat maggot in my hand – These are
    all private except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable – He
    is illustrating at some length that nothing can ever be accomplished on the
    verbal level – Faces of The City poured through silent as fish, stained with
    vile addictions and insect lusts – Like a self-deforming cast that will
    continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh
    will transmute from point to point – A step lower and the strangeness creeps
    in: perceiving that the world is ‘dense,’ sensing to what degree a stone is
    foreign and irreducible to us, to what intensity nature or a landscape can
    negate us – In reality there is no experience of death<br /><br />But the
    corporation works more deeply to impose a modulation of each salary, in
    states of perpetual metastability that operate through challenges, contests,
    and highly comic group sessions – But we can easily become the victims as
    well as the beneficiaries of these systems. We must learn how to handle
    words effectively – By contrast, how the gravity of nature and her silence
    startle you, when you stand face to face with her, undistracted, before a
    barren ridge or in the desolation of the ancient hills – A frozen moment
    when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork – Mutually exclusive
    realms of experience – If the most idiotic television game shows are so
    successful, it’s because they express the corporate situation with great
    precision – After a few months of this the citizens were cowered in corners
    like neurotic cats – The word is divided into units which be all in one
    piece and should be taken so, but the pieces can be had in any order being
    tied up back and forth in and out fore and aft like an inneresting sex
    arrangement – Individuals have become “dividuals,” and masses, samples,
    data, markets, or “banks” – There is the pleasurable orgasm, like a rising
    sales graph – Psychosomatic medicine has demonstrated that patients with
    certain character structures are more disposed to certain illnesses. We can
    go further: characterological and metabolic alteration can be induced by
    environmental pressures – The card could just as easily be accepted or
    rejected on a given day or between certain hours; what counts is not the
    barrier but the computer that tracks each person’s position, licit or
    illicit, and effects a universal modulation – The Examiner, when he stopped
    a large group, would only examine and stamp the cards of a few. The others
    were then subject to arrest because their cards were not properly stamped –
    It is not difficult to pressure large numbers of potential or actual enemies
    towards a way of life that will bring them within range of our biological
    agent – We now have substance X which can be introduced into the water
    supply – The citizens rushed from one bureau to another in a frenzied
    attempt to meet impossible deadlines. All benches were removed from the
    city.<br /><br />
    Reinstate the world in its diversity and deny the transcendent power of
    reason – Only in the far east that landscape painters regarded their art as
    religious – Reducing valve of brain and ego – For a second we cease to
    understand it because for centuries we have understood it in solely the
    images and designs that we had attributed to it beforehand – Distorts every
    given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or
    explanatory abstraction – The world evades us because it becomes itself
    again. The stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it is – He
    situates himself in relation to time – You have seen half a person cut in
    two by a car, bits and pieces of street signs and advertisements,
    reflections from shop windows.<br /><br /> </i
  >Your Erroneous Zones<i
    >. I really take my hat off to that title. It hits the reader right where he
    lives. And gooses him right up to the cash register – Continuous forms of
    control, and the effect in the school of perpetual training, the
    corresponding abandonment of all university research, the introduction of
    the “corporation” at all levels of schooling – Never static, always in flux,
    sections being painted out and annihilated with the same pitch and rhythm as
    the ones taking substance. The demolition of self. A sucking vortex –
    Demolition incorporated in the structural design. A nod to mortality – And
    to be able to bear the sight of this terrible corpse’ face in mirrors, he
    tries to convince himself that the lessons of experience are engraved in it
    – A mutilated fragment of the human potential, specialized to the point
    where he cannot exist without a host – Old elephants limp off to the hills
    to die; old Americans drive themselves to death with huge cars – All he can
    do is go to the mental equivalent of Australia and look around him – Words
    dimly familiar, but twisted all awry like faces in a funhouse mirror – “Wa?
    Where am I, what is the basketbally game of eternity the girls are playing
    here by me in the old house of my life, the house isn’t on fire is it?” – A
    montage of fragments – You will encounter all sorts of creatures at least as
    odd as kangaroos. You did not invent these creatures any more than you
    invent marsupials.<br /><br />When his establisment empties, his head
    empties too – But we felt that he was making crab-like or lobster-like
    thoughts in his head – “If you look at yourself too long in the mirror,
    you’ll see a monkey in there” – And I said “What’s the matter with you. You
    crazy?” And I looked into his bright eyes and saw that he was – What I can
    see is below the monkey, on the edge of the vegetable world, at the polyp
    level – Vibrations of television telepathy surrounded the room – Now the
    poster is torn, the simple, deliberate links which joined them have
    disappeared but another unity has established itself of its own accord –
    “Did you ever read The Book of Tea?”
