  I bought a secondhand 7th gen Kindle recently and decided to jailbreak it
  because I hate Amazon and feel that it is my duty to do the equivalent of
  installing Linux on every device I can get my hands on. My jailbreak involved
  installing

    >KUAL</a

  and <a href="https://koreader.rocks/" target="_blank">KOReader</a> with the
  help of
  <a href="https://github.com/KindleModding/WinterBreak" target="_blank"
    >WinterBreak</a
  >. You may be wondering what reasons there are for doing this outside the
  standard freetard spiel--I was pretty unsure, going into it, but this is what
  I found:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Calibre integration</li>
  <li>SSH capability</li>
  <li>Better ability to sideload books (via USB transfer, SFTP, or Calibre)</li>
  <li>Compatibility with way more file types (MOBI, CBZ, etc.)</li>
  <li>
    A million more customisation options in KOReader as opposed to the default
    Kindle reader
  </li>
  <li>KOReader plugins and patches</li>
  <li>Custom screensavers</li>
  <li>In-depth reading statistics</li>
</ul>

  I'm working with a 7th gen Kindle Paperwhite. You can use this article as a
  tutorial is you have a the same or a similar model, but it won't the cover
  anything outside the scope of what I did. Check
  <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-models" target="_blank">here</a> to
  see which methods are compatible with which model. If you own a 7th gen
  Paperwhite and are considering doing this, make sure you are not on firmware
  5.18.1 or beyond.

  My starting place and primary source was the
  <a href="https://kindlemodding.org" target="_blank">Kindle Modding Wiki</a>.
  Some of the resources are outdated, but it generally serves as a great guide,
  along with
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRW_EYDcW1o" target="_blank"
    >this video</a
  >.

<ol>
  <li>
    To start, I downloaded WinterBreak to my laptop (<a
      href="https://github.com/KindleModding/WinterBreak/releases/latest/download/WinterBreak.tar.gz"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >) and extracted it. Then I put my Kindle into airplane mode and rebooted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once booted, I plugged it into my laptop and copied the extracted files
    (there is a hidden file: <code>.active_content_sandbox</code>. make sure not
    to miss it). Once this was complete I ejected the Kindle from the computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the Kindle, I opened the store and disabled airplane mode. It opened into
    <a href="https://kindlemodding.org/mesquito/" target="_blank">Mesquito</a>
    and from there I launched WinterBreak (at this stage, delete
    <code>update.bin.partial</code> from the Kindle if present to prevent an
    automatic update). Wait until it says something along the lines of "Now you
    are ready to install the hotfix".
  </li>
  <li>
    The hotfix ensures that the jailbreak will persist after updating. It can be
    downloaded
    <a
      href="https://github.com/KindleModding/Hotfix/releases/latest/download/Update_hotfix_universal.bin"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >. I plugged the Kindle into the laptop again and copied
    <code>Update_hotfix_universal.bin</code> to it, then ejected it. Clicked on
    the three dots in the corner if the screen and selected
    <i>Update Your Kindle</i>. Once the hotfix had finished installing I ran the
    <i>Run Hotfix</i> booklet to install it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once this was done I plugged the Kindle back in to install the MPRI package
    manager and KUAL launcher. (<a
      href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >
    under <i>KUAL & KUAL extensions</i>; <i>MR Package Installer</i> for MRPI
    and <i>KUAL (coplate)</i> for KUAL). Extracted the MRPI archive and copied
    <code>extensions/</code> and <i>mrpackages/</i> to Kindle. Extracted KUAL
    archive and copied <code>Update_KUALBooklet_*_install.bin</code> to Kindle.
    Updated kindle via three-dot menu again. Once finished and rebooted, KUAL is
    installed as a booklet.
  </li>
  <li>
    To prevent OTA updates (which break the jailbreak) I downloaded the
    <a
      href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4076733&postcount=25"
      target="_blank"
      >RenameOTA</a
    >
    KUAL extension and copied the extracted ZIP to the
    <code>extensions/</code> directory on the Kindle. (this process is different
    on firmware &lt;=5.10.x, see Kindle Modding Wiki). Opened KUAL and selected
    <i>Rename OTA Binaries</i> and <i>Rename</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the Kindle had rebooted I downloaded the <i>kindlehf</i> KOReader
    package to my laptop from
    <a
      href="https://build.koreader.rocks/download/nightly/v2025.08-133-gb86f21ac0_2025-10-26/?C=M&O=D"
      target="_blank"
      >here</a
    >. Extracted package and copied files to Kindle.
  </li>
</ol>
<br />
<p>
  With KOReader installed, it can be launched from KUAL. I end up installing
  various plugins and patches to KOReader, my favourite being
  <a href="https://github.com/joshuacant/ProjectTitle" target="_blank"
    >ProjectTitle</a
  >
  (a complete UI overhaul). You can find more on Github and

  I don't know what else to say, really, but jailbreaking is absolutely worth it
  and I would highly recommend it. Here's a picture of my Kindle:
