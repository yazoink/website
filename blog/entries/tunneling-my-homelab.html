<p>Tunneling my homelab to a VPS was really a lot easier than I expected. For a good while I was reluctant to buy a VPS since I didn't know if I was actually going to get it to work, but after seeing <a href='https://blog.ahwx.org/frp' target='_blank'>this article about frp</a> I decided to give it a go.</p><br /><p>The VPS I've gone with is a 2 GB Linode running Alpine Linux and my home servers are running NixOS.</p><p>To enable frp on my home server, I've added a module like this:</p><br /><div class='code-block'><code><p>{</p><p>&emsp;services.frp = {</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;enable = true;</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;role = "client";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;settings = {</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;serverAddr = "vps.public.ip.address";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;serverPort = 7000;</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;auth.method = "token";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;auth.token = "my token";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;transport.protocol = "tcp";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;proxies = [</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;name = "my service";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;type = "tcp";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;localIP = "service.local.ip";</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;localPort = service port number;</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;remotePort = service port number;</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;];</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;};</p><p>&emsp;};</p><p>}</p></code></div><br /><p>To enable it on the VPS I installed frp with <code>doas apk add frp</code> and wrote the following to <code>/etc/frp/frps.toml:</code></p><br /><div class='code-block'><code><p>bindPort = 7000</p><p>auth.method = "token"</p><p>auth.token = "my token"</p></code></div><br /><p>And that's all there is to it! You can now access all the forwarded services from the address of your VPS.</p><br /><p>I also use Caddy as a reverse proxy to enable HTTPS and map the all of the services to subdomains. To do this all you need is to install Caddy and create a file under <code>/etc/caddy/Caddyfile</code> that looks something like this:</p><br /><div class='code-block'><code><p>"myservice.domain.tld" {</p><p>&emsp;reverse_proxy vps.public.ip:port</p><p>}</p></code></div><br /><p>So far it's been very fast and stable, I definitely reccommend trying this if you're looking for a way to host your homelab publically without port forwarding or revealing your IP.</p>
