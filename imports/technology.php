<h2>This Server</h2>
<br>
<p>
  This website is currently being hosted on my home server which consists of two
  machines running NixOS tunneled to a Linode 2 GB VPS.

<h3>Laptops</h3>
<br>
<p>My primary laptop is a ThinkPad T430 which I flashed with the 
  <a href='https://github.com/merge/skulls' target='_blank'>Skulls</a> 
  Coreboot image. I also upgraded the processor to an i7-3632QM (the best compatible
  35W chip), installed a 2 TB SSD in the SATA bay and a 250(?) GB NVME with an 
  ExpressCard adaptor, maxed out the RAM to 16 GB, and replaced the CPU cooler with 
  the iGPU model.</p>
<p>I got it for free from a scrap pile which was pretty neat.</p>
<br>
<p>
  My secondary/portable laptop is an Acer TravelMate B113 built from scrap parts. I
  have a blog article about it

<h3>Desktop</h3>
<br>
<p>
  My desktop PC has a Ryzen 5 5600 processor, Radeon RX 6600 graphics card, 16 GB
  DDR4 RAM, and a lot of drives (the primary being a 500-ish GB NVME SSD). I forgot
  the motherboard model. Case is a surprisingly good Corsair case from 2019 that I
  found on the side of the road. Also forgot the model and can't be bothered to 
  check.

<p>
  All of my computers run NixOS. I use Hyprland as my window manager. You can find
  my configs/rice

<br>
<h3>Misc.</h3>
<br>
<p>My phone is a secondhand Pixel 6 with a broken mic, running GrapheneOS. I also
use a Kindle Paperwhite 7 as an e-reader, jailbroken and running KOReader.</p>
