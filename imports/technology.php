      This website is currently being hosted on my home server which consists of two
      machines running NixOS tunneled to a Linode 2 GB VPS. You can read more about
      how I tunnel my services in 
      <a href='/?nav=blog&entry=tunneling-my-homelab' target='_blank'>this blog post</a>.
      <br><br>
      Both machines are pretty similar builds, each with i5-8400 processors, 8 GB DDR4 RAM,
      a large variety of random drives, and the same motherboards
      (forgot the model). One server has a GTX 750 and the other has a GTX 750 ti.

<h2>My Daily Drivers</h2>
<br>
<h3>Laptops</h3>
<br>
<p>
  My primary laptop is a ThinkPad X220, which I found on the side of the road and flashed with Libreboot. It has 8 GB or RAM, an i5-2520M processor and a 500 GB SSD.

    <p>My secondary (as of recently) laptop is a ThinkPad T430 (salvaged from a scrap pile) which I flashed with the 
      <a href='https://github.com/merge/skulls' target='_blank'>Skulls</a> 
      Coreboot image. I also upgraded the processor to an i7-3632QM (the best compatible
      35W chip), installed a 2 TB SSD in the SATA bay and a 250(?) GB NVME with an 
      ExpressCard adaptor, maxed out the RAM to 16 GB, and replaced the CPU cooler with 
      the iGPU model.<br><br>

<h3>Desktop</h3>
<br>
<p>
  My desktop PC has a Ryzen 5 5600 processor, Radeon RX 6600 graphics card, 16 GB
  DDR4 RAM, and a lot of drives (the primary being a 500-ish GB NVME SSD). I forgot
  the motherboard model. Case is a surprisingly good Corsair case from 2019 that I
  found on the side of the road. Also forgot the model and can't be bothered to 
  check.

<br>
<h3>Misc.</h3>
<br>
<p>My phone is a secondhand Pixel 6 with a broken mic, running GrapheneOS. I also
use a Kindle Paperwhite 7 as an e-reader, jailbroken and running KOReader.</p>
<br>
<h3>Software</h3>
<br>
<p>
  All of my computers run NixOS. I use Hyprland as my window manager. You can find
  my configs/rice
