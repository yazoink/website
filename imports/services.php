<h1>Services...</h1>
<br>
<p>I host a few instances of open source frontends for various popular websites. You can use addons like <a href='https://libredirect.github.io/' target='_blank'>Libredirect</a> to automatically redirect links from the original sites to the alternatives.</p>
<br>
<p>These are all hosted on my home server, which you can find out more about <a href='<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>?nav=Technology'>here</a>.</p>
