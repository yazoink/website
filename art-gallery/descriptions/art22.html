  Created for a Scratch game I made as an assignment, you can play it
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/887728581/" target="_blank">here</a
  >. The primary inspiration was probably <i>Yume Nikki</i>.

  In the game I made it so the background warps ever so slightly to give a
  nearly imperceptible psychedelic affect.
