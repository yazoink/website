  And there he was, looming in the periphery of my vision. Mass of congealing
  leeches (or was it just over-activity of the visual cortex in the absence of
  light?), only somewhat concealed in a dark overcoat, sucking the light from
  the room with toothy eyeless mouths. Following my gaze, never in focus. A
  sense of the smell of rot, permeating. The shivering cold of complete absence
  in the air caressing my skin, threatening to penetrate.

  I lay there in a daze. Vague hypnogogic thoughts leaped and howled from the
  onion-skin centre of awareness like the onion had been cut and bruised and its
  sharp juices were polluting the air. The harnesses of light dreamy sleep,
  loose and vague around me. Buzz of electric haze of confused brain-cells,
  temperature rising and falling arbitrarily.

  I closed my eyes and began to count sheep... One... Two... And these faces:
  spectral faces of lost species in various states of decomposition began rising
  and flashing from the static, making themselves known as if it were their sole
  purpose; the sheep, evaporating into the hum and buzz, and I wondered what I'd
  done to deserve this, my indefinite sentence. Condemned to this prison of
  delirium.
