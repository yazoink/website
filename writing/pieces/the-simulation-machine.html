<h3>1. The Foundations</h3>
<br />
<p>How accurately can you artificially simulate life?</p>
<br />
<p>
  Imagine a computer with all the knowledge in the universe -- everything that
  has ever happened. It could then, throetically, predict the future --
  everything that ever will happen -- through cause-and-effect. This is probably
  impossible.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We can explain a lot of the mechanisms of reality through the medium of
  science. We can predict the weather with decent accuracy, and we know that the
  Earth revolves around the Sun. We know that water will boil at 100 degrees and
  freeze at 0. We can disassemble, analyse, and deconstruct our physical reality
  to a fair extent. We can also somewhat predict what other people are thinking
  and feeling through signifiers such as language and behavior.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We are given the impression that reality has some sort of a solid foundation
  -- a concrete foundational web of cause-and-effect -- quantifiable rules and
  concrete definitions. But, obviously, we cannot explain <i>everything</i> yet.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Science can tell us that the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second,
  and that nothing can exceed it. It's a solid datum -- holds a cool, reassuring
  air. It tells us of a precise point on which we can comfortably stand in the
  physical world. Good to know.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  But if we are to regard this as immutable scientific truth, how do we, then,
  factor in black holes? It's an ineluctable contradiction. The gravity of a
  black hole traps everything, including light. A Black hole <i>requires</i> the
  impossible -- none of our comfortable worldly datums can apply in its
  presence.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  There are circumstances in which no known laws of science can apply. I am not
  saying that it will never be possible for science to explain these phenomena,
  but that any of our "fixed" rules can broken at any time. Ever seen a
  ghost?...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  But the universe will die one day -- at least as we know it. Nothing is
  invincible and nothing is permanent. Everything will give at some point --
  including the laws of nature. Regardless, as humans, we still classify and
  enumerate some seemingly solid laws of reality. We deconstruct it down to the
  raw materials of billion-year-old carbon (we are stardust, we are golden...).
  But exactly how far can we deconstruct this physical reality?
</p>
<br />
<p>In <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, Albert Camus says:</p>
<br />
<p>
  <i
    >In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth. Socrates' "Know
    thyself" has as much value as the "Be virtuous" of our confessionals. They
    reveal a nostalgia at the same time as an ignorance. They are sterile
    exercises on great subjects. They are legitimate only in precisely so far as
    they are approximate.</i
  >
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <i
    >And here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its
    taste. These scents of grass and stars at night, certain evenings when the
    heart relaxes -- how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I
    feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that
    this world is mine. You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it.
    You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are
    true. You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases. At the final stage
    you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to
    the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron. All this
    is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible
    planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain
    this world to me with an image. I realize then that you have been reduced to
    poetry: I shall never know. Have I the time to become indignant? You have
    already changed theories. So that science that was to teach me everything
    ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that
    uncertainty is resolved in a work of art.</i
  >
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We can dissect our world down to certain building blocks, but if we keep
  going, we hit a wall where all knowledge ends. We have no foundational
  knowledge of <i>anything</i>. How can we, then, claim anything as concrete
  scientific truth?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  We don't understand the system; we are simply making approximations within the
  confines its walls. Scientists will say that the universe started with "The
  Big Bang" but nobody can actually define what "The Big Bang" means; it all
  just boils down to semantic padding around the eternal question mark. All of
  human understanding is construction; a precarious sand-castle -- subject to
  collapse under too much or the wrong kind of pressure.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Is it possible to measure or enumerate anything in this reality; can anything
  truly be placed in a concrete categorical box? Or is it all so complex and
  infinite that there cannot be more than one singular instance of any given
  <i>thing</i>?... Space stretches out infinitely in all directions. Must it,
  then, be infinitely divisible? There is no limit to the amount of times a
  number can be divided, just as there is no limit to the number of times it can
  be multiplied.
</p>
<br />
<h3>2. The Truth</h3>
<br />
<p>
  In a world of infinity, nothing can be solidly defined; including "truth." You
  can't touch "truth." Everyone who uses the word is referring to something
  different.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The words "fact" and "science" are often imbued with an undue heaviness. -- If
  your reaction to this statement was a flash-bulb of suspicion, you are further
  demonstrating my point. They appear as if they expand beyond the human scope
  to something celestial and untouchable. But you must remember that words serve
  solely as abstractions -- sets of common traits and associations dressed up in
  vaudeville costumes; outlandish, absurd, and obscene. They are actors. They
  are an elaborate system for encoding the abstract material of thought into a
  standardised, digestible format.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Words operate in the same man-made binary realm as the computer and the facts
  of science, and by their very nature, can never be universally defined because
  it is impossible to wholly communicate <i>anything</i> in the infinite realm.
  The encoding is lossy at best. Take this passage from
  <i>The Doors of Perception</i> by Aldous Huxley:
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <i
    >We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in
    all circumstances we are by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the
    arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers desperately try to
    fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By
    its very nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in
    solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies -- all these are private
    and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We can pool
    information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From
    family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes.</i
  >
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Definitions depend on Whole communication -- full seamless sender-to-reciever
  operation. How else are we supposed to come to an agreement on anything? Whole
  communication is impossible within the human scope, as every living thought is
  built from the raw materials of circumstance and memory.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The meaning of a word is primarily circumstantial -- it's vague and blurry on
  its own. A word of which you do not know the meaning takes on the meaning of
  the absence of its meaning. Every word has different connotations to each
  individual person, under every individual circumstance. Most of the meaning we
  derive from words is inferred from context: if you have a memory associated
  with a certain word, your definition will always be tainted with it. The same
  word can mean something completely different when placed in a different
  context. A sentence can take on an entirely different meaning with the
  addition or removal or manipulation of a singular word. Every time a word
  enters your consciousness a new connotation is annexed. The factors sprawl out
  as infinite as space.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Denotation is a myth. Definitions drift, mutate, metastasize, and distort.
  It's the deep archaic desire of the pattern-seeking mind for everything to be
  contained and secure in a neat box. It's all too common to fall into the trap
  of viewing the world <i>primarily</i> through these man-made systems. When you
  sever your perception at these arbitrary definitions and stop-points, your
  capacity for capturing the information through which you interpret the world
  is severely limited. It serves to construct a sense of reality that is
  comfortable, but <i>could</i> collapse at any point.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  To convey a Whole thought would be to convey the Whole universe. Where is the
  line at which a thought ends? There is no line. Whole communication can only
  exist in a finite binary realm.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Nonetheless, we define and communicate everything, including our "laws of
  reality" through this neutered, malleable medium of words; and it's not
  difficult to see why humanity has such an affinity for it: aside from the
  obvious point of its convenience, we know that it serves as a system of
  abstractions -- approximations and enumerations of patterns. We are wired to
  be pattern-seekers. Where would we be without this behavior? We are drawn to
  it because it lets us put things in neat boxes. We have a box for danger, a
  box for safety, a box for food, a box for family, a box for friends, a box for
  enemies... the list goes on until you have a whole vocabulary of patterns.
</p>
<br />
<p>The conscious condition is to match patterns in a realm of infinity.</p>
<br />
<h3>3. The Machine, Real and in the Flesh</h3>
<br />
<p>
  The prediction machine I mentioned earlier bears a lot of similarities to
  Artificial Intelligence. It may even serve as a logical conclusion to it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  There has been a rising trend of attempts at training Large Language Models to
  emulate human beings (commonly seen on platforms such as character.ai) and
  there is a large ongoing debate as to whether AI could ever gain sentience (or
  perhaps it already has?).
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The base mechanism of Artificial Intelligence is an algorithm that teaches
  itself. LLMs are fed large sets of data which get spliced and reconfigured in
  optimal accordance to a prompt. There is some similarity between this and the
  mechanism of human memory and pattern recognition. How much data must be fed
  to an AI before it can accurately simulate a human being?
</p>
<br />
<p>
  On the 14th of September, 2025, a megachurch in Texas played an AI-generated
  audio clip of Charlie Kirk saying words he never said to a congregation who
  gave it a standing ovation. This reaction, along with the popularity of
  character.ai and similar apps, suggests that it doesn't need much in order to
  at least be somewhat convincing.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Will AI ever be capable of accurately emulating a human reaction? Exactly what
  somebody would say, given a certain prompt? It amounts to a false comparison
  because the human being and the computer reside in entirely different realms.
  An AI is capable of identifying certain themes in the data its given, such as
  speech patterns or certain biases. It may be able to construct responses that
  appear to fit your "box" pertaining to a human individual. It may be
  convincing, but it will forever remain as accurate as a broken clock. The
  mental model you keep of an individual is an encoding of infinite fragmented
  memories and associations -- it is an arbitrary, reductive category, just as
  the Word.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The action or reaction of a human being is founded on an infinite number of
  factors which are unique to individual memories, neural connections, and
  circumstances. These factors are constantly in flux and can never be repeated.
  The machine is confined to a binary realm; its entire world can be reduced to
  a finite number of bits. All communication from the infinite realm must be
  filtered and encoded accordingly -- ...data lost and garbled in translation --
  diffused accuracy of a dream; twisted spectral face of a memory...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Which version are you trying to emulate? The human condition is not stable.
  Blood is pumping, stomach digesting, cells dying, regenerating, sleep is on
  the horizon, headache burgeoning, black mold on the ceiling -- an effluvium of
  infinity radiating from every orifice -- old Mortein jingle smeared across the
  door in ectoplasm... -- Which precise moment of living human time? Can you
  pick out a singular point? Divide it into units? A singular moment -- take a
  snapshot? I certainly can't. Your time is incompatible with mine, you
  understand? Beyond your scope.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The condition of computer is wholly stable. It exists in its own isolated
  universe, completely incompatible with the Living; at your mercy. The human
  essence is out of scope. The living world cannot be translated into its
  language. The raw materials of life cannot be captured or simulated.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The computer can never achieve anything beyond finite pattern matching and
  cause-and-effect. It is perpetually bound to true and false because they are
  the fundamental building blocks of its world.
</p>
<br />
<p>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</p>
<br />
