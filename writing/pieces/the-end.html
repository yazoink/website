<p>A sense of death hung in the room like a thick, sickly smog.</p>
<br />
<p>
  It poured from the two-dollar-shop transistor radio in forgotten late-night
  symphonies. The crackling, deteriorated sound of better times.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  It gathered on the off-white paint that half-heartedly clung to the drywall;
  sticky with remains of the past, present, and future.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The room stood steady, unsympathetic, but still bearing the marks of
  unrelenting years of decay and bereavement carried by each and every poor soul
  dragged into its belly.
</p>
<br />
<p>I wonder how many have left that room in a bag.</p>
<br />
<p>
  The ghastly presence of countless lost souls cemented themselves in the air.
  Cemented themselves in the crevices, nooks and crannies of your mind. Begging
  and pleading to be remembered.
</p>
<br />
<p>Reduced to nothing but a lingering sense of The End.</p>
