<p>
  Ever feel like you're on the threshold of something? Like the space-time
  fabric has frayed a little bit and your peripheral vision starts to blur and
  distort...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  You walk down the street and everything looks transitory and a little too
  bright. I can remember going down old High Street and the sun beating down on
  me... closing in...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  The sun closing in on me... thoughts closing in on themselves... burgeoning
  tension in the temples and back of the neck... everything feels like a replica
  of itself in some inexplicable way...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Think about every cell in your body and the blood pumping through your veins
  and it's really all just too much...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  All that you can do is take some godforsaken bus to nowhere; do some loitering
  and window-shopping, stare at your stale, decaying fingertips.
</p>
<br />
<p>Knock on faux wood that you're just fooling yourself.</p>
