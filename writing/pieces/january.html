<p>
  Languid black dust in the night... Glimmer of police lights in the bathroom
  window...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Twinges of metal and vague fireworks... A face comprised of bright
  two-dimensional shapes -- sacred geometry of fear... Tracing the sinking
  feeling of the gut with stale yellow fingers...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Imaginary astral projection through the cool shiny window, fly-screen torn.
  Old glass bottle on the shelf stained with red Castlemaine dirt -- maybe
  1856...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Chemical effluvium of bottom-shelf gin and home-brand tonic. Smooth round
  ideas contort and tremble -- Neck cracks like a glowstick on Christmas Eve...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Nostalgia of twinkling LED lights, all along the boulevard -- grown a dusty
  brown exoskeleton... The scene stained with bright electrical static and
  lingering patches of light...
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Traces of unknown guilt -- dubious origin... Hands involuntarily surround face
  -- going in for the catch... Portable fan staring directly at me with its big
  indifferent grey eye -- sharp bladed iris.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Wincing precarious flesh -- Warm January moonlight gleams in humid
  malevolence...
</p>
