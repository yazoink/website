<p>I want to walk you through the hazy outskirts of the suburbs of my mind.</p>
<br />
<p>
  Through transient scenes and vague characters, through effluvia of nostalgia
  and the anonymous lives of familiar strangers, then out to the country.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Down endless battered roads that lead to obscure viable future circumstances
  and prophecies built from eroded and shattered memories. To the
  all-encompassing small towns where only the crazies and the truly free can
  bear to linger for more than a few hours.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  I want to share my every living thought, assimilate my being in full. To have
  another look at me through knowing, sympathetic eyes that can effortlessly
  penetrate the exoskeleton of fear and confusion.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  But here we are, stuck in the city. An air of caution and dread hangs through
  every crevice of every street corner and every house and every cafe, like a
  god.
</p>
<br />
<p>Here I am in my vow of silent affability.</p>
